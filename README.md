# Elite Observatory
Tool for reading/monitoring Elite Dangerous journals for interesting objects.

## How To Use
Simply run the exe anywhere on a machine with Elite Dangerous installed. It should automatically locate your journal files, but if for some reason it cannot it will ask for a folder to use.

Once running, you can scan your previously existing journals for interesting object, or begin monitoring for new events and add new discoveries on the fly.

From the settings window you have the option to disable checks for different types of discoveries, to turn on toast or text-to-speech notifications, and are given a very basic interface to edit the format of data copied out of the main list window.

## Prerequisites for use
.NET 4.5, and by extension Windows Vista or later.

## Prerequisites for building
C# 7.0, Newtonsoft.Json, System.ValueTuple

Optional: ILMerge
